Averaged event-related potential (ERP) data recorded from the human
scalp reveals electroencephalographic (EEG) activity that is reliably
time-locked and phase-locked to experimental events. We report here the
application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one
or more ERPs recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of
components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely-activated,
maximally independent time courses. Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal
to the number of sensors.  The derived components have distinct but not
necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting
methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators
in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such
as principal component analysis (PCA), ICA also minimizes higher-order
dependencies. Applied to detected- and undetected-target ERPs from an
auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten
components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or
more ICA components with relatively simple scalp distributions.  Three
of these components were active only when the subject detected the
targets, three other components only when the target went undetected,
and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the
steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train.  Major
features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes
in sensor number and placement. This new method of ERP analysis can be
used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and
subject states.

Because of the distance between the skull and brain
and their different resistivities, electroencephalographic
(EEG) data collected from any point on the human scalp
includes activity generated within a large brain area. 
This spatial smearing of EEG data by volume conduction
does not involve significant time delays, however, suggesting that
the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and
Sejnowski (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) is suitable for
performing blind source separation on EEG data. The ICA
algorithm separates the problem of source identification
from that of source localization.  
First results of applying the ICA algorithm to EEG data collected 
during a sustained auditory detection task show: 
(1) ICA training is insensitive to different random seeds.
(2) ICA analysis may be used to segregate obvious artifactual EEG 
components (line and muscle noise, eye movements) from other sources. 
(3) ICA analysis is capable of isolating overlapping alpha and theta wave 
bursts to separate ICA channels (4) Nonstationarities in EEG
and behavioral state  can be tracked using ICA analysis via
changes in the amount of residual correlation between
ICA-filtered output channels.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because of the spread of electromagnetic signals through CSF and skull
through volume conduction, EEG data recorded at different points 
on the scalp tend to be correlated.  
Bell and Sejnowski (1995) have recently presented
an artificial neural network algorithm that identifies and separates 
statistically independent signals from a number of
channels composed of linear mixtures of an equal number of sources.
Here we present a first application of this Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm to human EEG data. 
Conceptually, ICA filtering separates the problem of source
identification in EEG data from the related problem of
physical source localization. Three subjects performed a
continuous auditory detection task in two half hour sessions. 
ICA filters trained on 14-channel
EEG data collected during these sessions identified 14
statistically independent source channels which could then be
further processed using event-related potential (ERP),
event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), and other signal
processing techniques. One ICA source channel
contained most eye movement activity,
and another two collected line noise and muscle activity,
while others were free of these artifacts. 
Changes in spectral power in several ICA channels covaried
with changes in performance. If ICA sources can be shown to
have distinct and consistent relationships to behavior or
other physiological signals, ICA filtering may reveal
meaningful aspects of event-related brain dynamics
associated with sensory and cognitive processing but hidden
within correlated EEG responses at individual scalp sites.

 The problem of determining brain electrical sources from
potential patterns recorded on the scalp surface is
mathematically underdetermined. We have applied the
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of 
Bell and Sejnowski to the problem of source
identification (What) considered apart from source
localization (Where).  By maximizing the joint entropy of a
set of output channels derived from input signals by linear
filtering without time delays, the ICA algorithm attempts to
derive independent sources from highly correlated scalp EEG
signals without regard to the locations or configurations
(focal or diffuse) of the source generators. We report
simulation experiments to determine (1) whether the ICA
algorithm can successfully isolate independent components in
simulated EEG generated by focal and distributed sources,
and (2) whether ICA performance is severely affected by
sensor noise and additional low-level brain noise sources.
We will also show examples of ICA applied to actual EEG and
cognitive ERP data.

Independent Component Analysis of Event-related Potentials

Recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) can reveal the time course
of brain events associated with visual perception and selective attention.
ERP studies of visual-spatial attention indicate that cortical processing 
of stimuli appearing in the attended location is augmented as early as 80 ms 
after stimulus onset. However, separation of the multiple brain processes 
contributing to the surface-recorded components of ERP waveforms has proven 
difficult. Recently, an `infomax' algorithm for the blind separation of 
linearly mixed inputs has been devised (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) and 
applied to EEG and ERP analysis (Makeig et al., 1996). The neural generators 
of ICA sources are not specified by the algorithm and may be either physically compact or distributed. 
<P>
Results of applying this Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) algorithm to single-subject and group-mean ERPs
recorded during a visual selective attention experiment
(Anllo-Vento and Hillyard, 1996) suggest that ERP waveforms
represent a sum of overlapping, discrete and time-limited
brain processing events whose amplitudes are modulated by  
selective attention without affecting their time course.
These source components identified by ICA appear to index
independent stages of visual information processing. Spatial
attention operates on early source components in a manner
similar to a sensory gain-control mechanism, while later
components appear to reflect further processing of stimulus features and
feature conjunctions.

The problem of objectively decomposing event-related brain responses into 
neurophysiologically meaningful components is a major difficulty in the 
evoked response field. Traditional methods of identifying and measuring 
response subcomponents based on measuring the amplitudes and latencies 
of peak excursions in the waveforms at individual scalp sites fail when 
subcomponents overlap substantially, while current source localization 
procedures based on fitting single or multiple dipole models give 
ambiguous results when source geometry is unknown or complex. The 
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski
(1995) is an artificial neural network which maximizes the overall 
entropy of a set of non-linearly transformed input vectors using 
stochastic gradient ascent, without regard to the physical locations 
or configuration of the source generators. Trained on one or more 
multichannel electric or magnetic evoked responses, the algorithm converges 
on spatial filters which separate the input data into independent 
time courses and distinct scalp topographies arising in multiple, 
spatially-stationary 'effective brain sources.' Response decompositions 
produced by the ICA algorithm can be used to measure the
effects of experimental manipulations on individual response
components, even when these are overlapping in time or
space. Typically, response components identified by the
algorithm  are recaptured in repeated analyses, regardless
of changes in initial weights, sensor montage, and data
length. I will explain the theory and practise of ICA
decomposition and its differences from PCA, demonstrate
results of EEG simulations, and present applications to EEG
and MEG data analysis.

of stimuli appearing in the attended location is augmented as early as
80 ms after stimulus onset. However, separation of the multiple brain
processes contributing to the surface-recorded components of ERP
waveforms has proven difficult. Recently, an `infomax' algorithm for
the blind separation of linearly mixed inputs has been devised (Bell
and Sejnowski, 1995) and applied to EEG and ERP analysis (Makeig et
al., 1996). The neural generators of ICA sources are not specified by
the algorithm and may be either physically compact or distributed.
Results of applying this Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm
to single-subject and group-mean ERPs recorded during a visual
selective attention experiment (Anllo-Vento and Hillyard, 1996) suggest
that ERP waveforms represent a sum of overlapping, discrete and
time-limited brain processing events whose amplitudes are modulated by
selective attention without affecting their time course. These source
components identified by ICA appear to index independent stages of
visual information processing. Spatial attention operates on early
source components in a manner similar to a sensory gain-control
mechanism, while later components appear to reflect further processing
of stimulus features and feature conjunctions.

The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and
Sejnowski (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) is an
information-theoretic unsupervised learning algorithm  
which can be applied to the problem of separating multichannel
electroencephalographic (EEG) data into independent sources
(Makeig et al., 1996). We tested the potential usefulness of
the ICA algorithm for EEG source decomposition by
applying the algorithm to simulated EEG data. This data was 
constructed by projecting known input signals from single-
and multiple-dipole sources in a three-shell spherical model
head (Dale and Sereno, 1993) to simulated scalp sensors.
In different simulations, we (1) altered the relative source strengths, (2)
added multiple low-level sources (weak brain sources and sensor noise) to the
simulated EEG, and (3) permuted the simulated dipole source locations and
orientations. The algorithm successfully and reliably
separated the activities of relatively strong sources from
the activities of weaker brain sources and sensor noise,
regardless of source locations and dipole orientations.
These results suggest that the ICA algorithm should be able
to separate temporally independent but spatially overlapping
EEG activities arising from relatively strong brain and/or
non-brain sources, irrespective of their spatial distributions.

Event-Related Potential (ERP) averages of electrical responses to sensory stimuli
recorded at the human scalp capture voltage fluctuations both time locked and
phase locked to occurrence of the stimuli. It is widely suspected, 
though poorly documented, that in single stimulus epochs the response activity
may vary widely in both time course and scalp distribution. The major difficulty
in comparing single trials is that the spontaneous EEG activity may obscure
response-evoked activity, since spontaneous EEG is typically much larger
than the evoked response. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) constructs
spatial filters that can separate ERPs into spatially-fixed, temporally-sparse 
components that are temporally independent of one another. By adjusting the
amount of ERP and single-trial EEG data used to train the algorithm, the
resulting filters can separate larger EEG activity from ERP component activity,
allowing a more accurate analysis of changes in the time course and/or the spatial
distribution of ERP activity in single trials. Analysis of data from
an auditory ERP experiment supports the observation that the relative amplitudes, 
latencies and scalp distributions of individual ERP components vary
independently across single trials from the same subject and session.
For example, a component composing N100 may be measurable in some but not
all trials, independent of the presence of a component accounting for P300.
This suggests that EEG and ERP activity may interact in ways that deserve
further study.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a new signal processing technique
for decomposing spontaneous or evoked electrophysiological data into 
spatially fixed and temporally independent components.  ICA allows comparison 
of component amplitudes and time courses across related conditions.
Applied simultaneously to target and nontarget responses in 30 conditions 
of a visual selective attention experiment (see Westerfield et al., this session), 
ICA derived at least four components of the early visual evoked response which 
were differently amplitude-modulated by spatial location and attention 
without effects on component latency, but were not affected by the 
target/nontarget distinction. Other components accounted for data artifacts 
in single conditions.  Later components common to several conditions were 
sensitive to both spatial attention and target feature.  ICA allows quantitative 
comparison of objectively-derived and temporally-sparse ERP components and 
subcomponents across 30 or more stimulus or task conditions.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a new signal processing technique
for decomposing spontaneous or evoked EEG and MEG data into temporally
independent and spatially fixed components. The scalp distribution of the 
auditory steady-state response near 40 Hz appears to sweep from the front 
to the back of the scalp every cycle. ICA decomposes this apparent movement 
into the sum of at least two bilateral components with different scalp 
distributions and phase lags. ICA accounts for the transient perturbations
in SSRs produced by experimental events using the same components producing
the SSR, supporting the hypothesis that these transient (CERP) perturbations
represent modulation of the ongoing response. Application of ICA algorithms 
capable of both sub-Gaussian and super-Gaussian components will be presented 
and psychophysiological implications of new blind decomposition techniques
discussed.

A recently-derived 'infomax' algorithm for performing 
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a new
information-theoretic approach to the problem of separating
multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic
(MEG) data into temporally independent and spatially stationary
sources. In a previous report, we have shown that the
algorithm can separate simulated EEG source waveforms (independent simulated
brain source activities mixed linearly at the scalp sensors),
even in the presence of multiple low-level model brain and
sensor noise sources. Here, we demonstrate the ability
of the ICA algorithm to decompose brief event-related potential (ERP) 
data sets into temporally independent components by applying it
to simulated ERP-length EEG data synthesized from 3-sec (600-point)
electrocorticographic (ECoG) epochs recorded from the cortical surface
of a human undergoing pre-surgical evaluation.
<p>
Six asynchronous single-channel ECoG data epochs were projected through single- and
multiple-dipole model sources in a three-shell spherical head
model to six simulated scalp sensors to create 
simulated EEG data. In two sets of simulation experiments, we altered relative
source strengths, added multiple low-level sources (synthesized from
ECoG data and uniform- or Gaussian-distributed noise), and permuted the simulated
dipole source locations and orientations. The algorithm reliably
separated the activities of the relatively strong sources, regardless
of source location, dipole orientation, and low-level source distributions. 
Thus, the ICA
algorithm should identify relatively strong, temporally independent and
spatially overlapping ERP components arising from multiple brain and/or
non-brain sources, regardless of their spatial distributions.
This shows that the ICA algorithm can decompose ERPs generated by
uncorrelated sources. 
<p>
A third ERP simulation tests how the algorithm treats
a simulated ERP epoch constructed using model ERP generators whose
activations are partially correlated.  In this case, 
the algorithm parsed the simulated ERP waveforms into a sum of 
temporally independent and spatially stationary components reflecting 
the changing topography of correlated source activity in the simulated ERP data.
Each of the affected components sums activity from one or more
concurrently-active brain generators. This suggests the ICA algorithm 
may also be useful for identifying event-related changes 
in the correlation structure of either spontaneous or event-related EEG data.
Paradoxically, adding four simulated ``no response'' epochs 
to the training data minimized the relative importance of 
partial correlations in the original data epoch 
and allowed the algorithm to separate the concurrently active sources.
Likewise, submitting ERPs from more than one stimulus or experimental condition 
to concurrent ICA analysis may allow the algorithm to separate sources 
from brain generators whose activations are partially correlated 
in some but not all response conditions.
