The ICA/EEG toolbox has now been downloaded over 2100 times by users from 
over 50 countries and research fields.
Please email feedback about things that do or don't work, 
or any suggested improvements. If you improve your working 
versions of the scripts, please send me a copy or description.
I will credit your suggestions.

<b>New functions/features/fixes in 3.52 (as of 10/12/00):</B>
<p>
** rmart() - remove EOG artifacts from EEG data using multiple time-lag
   regression. Added back to the toolbox -- though we prefer using ICA for 
   this purpose! (See new publication below).
** envtopo(), a new [-n] option for arg 'compnums' directs envtopo() to
   show only the largest n (<=7) component envelopes and maps. Also, line
   colors and styles have been made bolder.
** binica() now uses unique filenames for data, script, weights and sphere
   files, to avoid conflicts when multiple binica() calls are made in the
   same pwd.
** binica() now reads the .wts file correctly when 'pca' ncomps < nchans in
** timef() fixed recent version bug in calculating output (and displayed)
   frequencies when cycles >0 - they were 1:n instead of actual Hz values! 
<p>
<strong>New functions in version 3.5 (as of 8/00):</strong>
<pre>
<font face="Helvetica,Ariel" size=3>
** <b>binica()</b> - calls binary ica (separate download) from the Matlab command 
   line (much faster and more memory-efficient than runica())
<br>
** <b>axcopy()</b> - window popup function incorporated into many plotting functions 
<p>
<b>New features/fixes:</B>
<p>
** <b>axcopy()</b> is now added to many plotting functions to allow the user 
    to pop up a window closeup of any subaxes with a mouse click and 
    to zoom in on plotted data in this new window.
<br>
** <b>erpimage()</b> now has amplitude significance bounds estimated and shown
    as well as an inter-trial coherence significance bound. 
<br>
** <b>erpimage()</b> now has a 'topo' map plotting option, plus axcopy()
    A bug that caused the y-axis labels to be missing when time limits were
    specified has been fixed.
<br>
** <b>erpimage()</b> now has a 'spec' plotting option - plots data spectrum
<br>
** <b>erpimage()</b> now has a new 'caxis' plotting option - causes the color map
    to use a specified fraction of data range instead of the whole data range
<br>
** <b>testica()</b> uses a new eyeLike() function, contributed by Benjamin Blankertz,
    in place of idit(), which failed in some circumstances.
<br>
** <b>testica()</b> now has new defaults and extra figures (for educational purposes)
<br>
** sph2pol is now <b>sph2topo()</b>, and pol2sph is pol2topo(). (cf. cart2topo())
<br>
** <b>envtopo()</b> has new 'comp_fill' and 'bold' options - they look sharp! 
<br>
** <b>plottopo()</b> now has easier color and vertical line specification
    It also performs popups using axcopy.
<br>
** <b>timef()</b> has a new 'details' argument that scrolls detailed notes on its 
    arguments, outputs, history, references and internal constants. 
<br>
** <b>floatread()</b> now takes size argument 'square'.
<br>
** <b>runica()</b> now allows nchans > nframes if 'pca' reduction is used to
    reduce the data dimension < nframes.
<br>
** <b>eegplot()</b> now has the cal bar turned 'on' and will accept an int vector
    of channel numbers
<p>
<em>Known bugs:</em>
<p>
** plottopo() was broken in the 3.5 release, fixed in 3.5.1 -sm
<br>
** In erpimage(), the 'phase' option may not work in MATLAB 5.2 (ok in 5.3)???
<br>
** In erpimage(), the 'allcohers' option is not debugged.

<b>News of ICA applications to biomedical research</b>
<p>
There were 10 papers on ICA applied to fMRI or PET data at the recent Human Brain 
Mapping meeting in Texas, and 10 ICA papers on ICA for MEG data at BioMag2000.
The ICA200 meeting, held in Helsinki in June, included nearly 200 papers and 
posters, with the final session on biomedical applications. 
<p>
The next ICA meeting, ICA2001 will be hosted by the Institute for 
Neural Computation, UCSD in early December, 2001 (just after NIPS) 
at Del Mar, CA.  For details, see http://ica2001.org
